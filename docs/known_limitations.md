# Known Issues and Limitations Using Elastic's detection-rules DAC Approach
================================

## Intermittent Exception List Kibana Import Issue

- There is an intermittent issue when importing many rules and exception lists at the same time that is currently being investigated related to [this Kibana issue](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/143864). This may cause exception list references to be stripped when importing rules in some cases. We implemented a helper message that will attempt to identify when this occurs and provide a command template that you can run to re-try to upload the rules that might have failed erroneously. This message will appear from the output of `kibana import-rules` if this situation is detected.

## Schema Validation Support

- While we try to maintain parody with Kibana schemas; however, when Kibana releases a schema update our schema updates lag behind theirs. If there is a schema validation issue where a schema needs updating, first check the [issues in detection rules](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/issues) to see if it is already being tracked. If not, please let us know and we will update the schemas as soon as we are able.

## No Direct Support

- Managing prebuilt rules via DaC workflows is not supported at the moment (this is being addressed).
- Rule loading
  - Core repo (loading Rule object)
    - Officially supports from  TOML to Rule object
    - Support for json yaml will exist but will remain in a dict format
      - This is only a convenience utility and will only be supported across minimal components, since all functionality depends on the validated object (and related pieces)
  - Kibana module does support raw dict's
  - We added a RawDictLoader as a util, but this will only serve to load rules to dicts, bypassing most of the value of the core repo
- Limited support for Exception and Action Lists:
  - Schema validation for exception or action lists are not available within the individual rule TOML files. You can add the fields manually to the TOML files, however validation is only available when managing these lists in separate TOML files in the custom folder. 
    - Data within the exceptions are not validated 
    - We recommend managing exception/action lists in Kibana and exporting the rules, which will include the list information per rule. 
  - The limited action/exception support within the detection-rules repo has two-way support to push mass updates to lists in Kibana. You can not currently export a single list from Kibana and save into the detection rule format.

## Potential Upcoming Enhancements

- Support for Kibana version or revision fields:
  - These two fields are not supported within detection-rules since Elastic uses the version lock file for versioning.
  - This means that for versioning, users have limited built-in approaches to version rules.
  - We recommend adopting the built-in versioning version.lock.json strategy.
  - This is tracked in: [#3620](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/issues/3620)
- Support for customizable folder structure:
  - There currently is no support for customizing the folder structure which decides how rules are stored on disk when downloaded from kibana (however, this can also be reconciled post download in whatever manner desired).
  - This means that users have to manually move rules to specific organized folders.
  - This is tracked in: [#3625](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/issues/3625)
