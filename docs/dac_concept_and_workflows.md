# DaC Concept and Workflows

================================

## Overview

Detection as Code (DaC) is a modern security approach that applies software development best practices to the creation, management, and deployment of security rules. By treating ‚Äúdetections‚Äù as traditional code, organizations can leverage version control systems (VCS), automate testing and deployment processes, and ensure consistency across their security information and event management (SIEM) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities. This methodology enhances collaboration among security teams, streamlines updates, and facilitates a more agile response to evolving threats.

DaC adoption is driven by several factors:

- **Ever-Growing Rule Sets**: Maintaining detection rules without DaC becomes untenable as the number of rules increases.
- **Expanding Threat Landscape**: The breadth of coverage needed to protect against emerging threats necessitates a scalable approach suitable for diverse skill sets amongst the team.
- **Drive Towards Security Team Maturity**: Implementing DaC encourages the development of mature, repeatable processes within security teams. It supports the maintenance of high-quality detections through systematic peer reviews and rigorous testing.
- **Broader Adoption of Automation**: The wider movement towards automation in technology environments, exemplified by the adoption of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles, calls for enhanced automation capabilities across all tools used by security teams. DaC aligns with this trend by integrating rule management into automated workflows, ensuring consistency, efficiency, and the ability to swiftly respond to new threats.
- **Compliance and Governance Requirements**: Many organizations are adopting DaC to meet certification compliance requirements for peer review, change control, and disaster recovery of SIEM detections. Implementing DaC ensures that security rules are developed, reviewed, and maintained following strict governance standards, providing auditable evidence of compliance.

## Applying DaC Principles to Rules in Elastic

Incorporating DaC principles into Elastic Security rules management workflows involves using VCS to track rule changes, employing continuous integration (CI) tools for validation and testing, and continuous deployment (CD) mechanisms to update detection rules within [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/introduction.html)‚Äôs Elastic Security seamlessly. This practice ensures that rule changes are systematically reviewed, tested and enables rapid deployment of updates to respond to new vulnerabilities and attack techniques.

### Prerequisites

To effectively apply DaC principles to Elastic Security, individuals or teams should have a foundational understanding of several key concepts and technologies:

- **Version Control Systems (VCS)**: Familiarity with VCS and tools (e.g. particularly Git), is crucial for tracking changes to detection rules and collaborating on rule development.
- **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Knowledge of CI/CD pipelines and how they facilitate automated testing and deployment processes.
- **Elastic Security**: An understanding of how Elastic Security functions, including creating and managing detection rules within Elastic Security.
- **Elastic Prebuilt Rules repository**: Exposure to the detection-rules repo.
- **Scripting and Automation**: Basic proficiency in scripting (e.g., Python, Shell) to automate rule deployment and management tasks.

### Who Will Benefit from This Guide

This guide is for security analysts, engineers, and architects who develop, deploy, and manage detection rules, especially within Elastic Security environments. It is particularly beneficial for:

- **Security Analysts**: who wish to leverage automation for more efficient rule management and to respond more rapidly to emerging threats.
- **Detection Engineers**: looking for methodologies to streamline detection logic development, testing, and deployment.
- **Security Team Leads**: seeking to implement best practices for rule version control, collaboration, and quality assurance within their teams.
- **DevOps Engineers**: involved in integrating security practices into CI/CD pipelines, aiming for a more cohesive and automated approach to security within their workflows.
- **IT Security Architects**: exploring ways to incorporate as-code principles into security operations to enhance agility, repeatability, and reliability.

There are many ways to implement DaC within Elastic Security ecosystems, but this reference provides a few examples to convey the core principles. It delineates various approaches and architectures to building DaC, catering to different operational models and organizational needs. By navigating through this reference, individuals will gain the insights and practical know-how to establish robust DaC workflows, leading to more streamlined security operations, enhanced collaboration across teams, and a solid foundation for integrating security practices within automated CI/CD pipelines.

## Managing Detection Rules beyond Elastic Security with VCS

While Elastic Security provides a user-friendly interface for creating and managing detection rules, integrating these rules with a VCS capability offers several advantages, and is the core of implementing an ‚Äúas code‚Äù approach. VCS allows for detailed tracking of rule changes, collaborative rule development, and the integration of rule management into broader CI/CD workflows. This reference documentation heavily biases the direct management of rules utilizing VCS *alongside* the **detection-rules** repository, to enhance detection rule lifecycle management. It offers high-level alternative options to considering posterity, but does not recommend implementing all of them.

However, this reference is meant to enable implementations of DaC even without the dependency on the rules repo, since a key feature of DaC is that it is necessarily highly customizable and dependent on exact use cases. As such, even if a specific component does not perfectly fit within a requirement, the many options provided should be consulted for inspiration to modify as needed. In other words, <u>the repo and the guide will not strive to solve *all* problems and requirements</u>, but rather, establish some reference architecture, best practices, and standards.

## How to use this reference

This resource describes principles to adopt a DaC approach to Elastic Security rule management. Whether you're looking to automate rule deployments, enhance rule validation processes, or streamline rule versioning and exception management, this guide offers a modular set of practices and components. Select and combine the options relevant to your specific needs and operational context to customize your detection rule management workflow.

When considering adopting a DaC approach, several discrete components should be taken into consideration. This viewpoint helps identify the high-level requirements for implementing DaC end-to-end while reinforcing the modular approach. This reference includes an explanation of the different options, with any specific implications across these components. See the DaC Diagram and [Delineation table](#core-components-of-dac-delineation) for more information on how these components overlap.

### Understanding the Layout of this Reference

The hierarchy of information is broken down as follows:

- Core component
  - (optional) sub-components
    - (Options)
      - ‚Ä¶
  - Options
    - Considerations based on applied governance model

As an example:

- Managing Detection Rules in a VCS (core component)
  - Creating Detection Rules (sub-component)
    - Manually Creating Rules Based on Template (option 1)
      - VCS as authoritative (governance model consideration)
        - ‚Ä¶
      - Elastic Security as authoritative (governance model consideration)
        - Not recommended!
      - Dual sync (governance model consideration)
        - Follow VCS as authoritative
      - Semi-Automatic Creation with the Rules CLI (option 2)

For simplicity, you can consider it slightly analogous to a recipe book, where, across each component (and sub-components), you have options based on your governance model, needs, and desires.

This diagram serves as a visual guide to the three primary environments where security rules are maintained:

1. Locally within a cloned repository, as indicated by the **user-org/detection-rules** component.
2. In various version control environments, such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Gitea, denoted by the **VCS** component.
3. Within the **Elastic Security** platform.

The diagram also outlines the synchronization methods between these environments:

- **Git Sync**: Manages the transfer of rules between the local repository and the VCS.
- **CI/CD Sync via APIs**: Handles the deployment and updating of rules from the VCS to Elastic Security.
- **REST API Sync**: Facilitates direct communication and rule synchronization between the local clone and Elastic Security.

This reference explains multiple strategies for synchronizing rules between the components. Depending on the chosen governance model, syncing may involve pushing rules from a local repository or VCS to Elastic Security or pulling rules from Elastic Security to be merged into the VCS or local repositories, ensuring that changes replicate across the development, version control, and operational environments.
