This guide is meant to enable the implementation of detections as code in a generic manner, through the application of its use on Elastic detection rules (SIEM). We will continue to maintain and improve this guide, especially in the early stages of the new code and adoption, with intent of this eventually stabilizing.

If you have any feedback or questions along the way, the best place to reach us is in the public slack channel for [security-rules-dac](https://elasticstack.slack.com/archives/C06TE19EP09).
